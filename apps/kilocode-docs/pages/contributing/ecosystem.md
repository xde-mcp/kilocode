# Building for the Kilo Ecosystem

## Community Branding Guidelines

We love seeing what the community builds on top of Kilo! To help you launch your projects while protecting the clarity of the Kilo brand, we ask that you follow these guidelines for naming and assets.

## Naming Community Products

If you are creating an integration, plugin, or derivative tool for the Kilo ecosystem and would like to use the Kilo name, please use the following naming format: **'[Your Product Name] for Kilo'**.

This naming convention is important because it ensures:

- **Independence:** The product is recognized as an independent project, not officially connected to Kilo as a company.
- **Maintenance:** Users understand the product is maintained and supported by you (the community creator), not the core Kilo team.
- **Clarity:** New users can easily distinguish between official Kilo releases and the diverse range of community-built integrations.

## Brand Assets & Logos

Developers are welcome to use any logos available in our open-source repositories to help identify their project's compatibility with Kilo. Please ensure they are used to indicate association or compatibility (e.g., "Works with Kilo") and not in a way that suggests the project is an official Kilo product.
