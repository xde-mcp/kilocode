## Where to Use Kilo

- **In your IDE** — [VS Code](/docs/code-with-ai/platforms/vscode), [JetBrains](/docs/code-with-ai/platforms/jetbrains), Cursor, Windsurf, and other VS Code forks
- [**CLI**](/docs/code-with-ai/platforms/cli) — Run Kilo from your terminal for scripting and automation
- **Web & Mobile** — Access Kilo from your [browser](/docs/code-with-ai/platforms/web-app) or [iOS/Android apps](/docs/code-with-ai/platforms/mobile)
- [**Slack**](/docs/code-with-ai/platforms/slack) — Chat with Kilo directly in your workspace

Your sessions sync across all of these, so you can start a task on your phone and finish it in your IDE.

## What Kilo Can Do

- [**Code with AI**](/docs/code-with-ai) — Generate, refactor, and debug code through natural conversation. Use specialized modes (Code, Architect, Debug, Ask) or create your own. Get inline suggestions with Autocomplete.
- [**Collaborate**](/docs/collaborate) — Share sessions, manage team settings, and track AI adoption across your organization.
- [**Automate**](/docs/automate) — Set up AI-powered code reviews, triage agents, and auto-fixers that open new PRs based on issues.
- [**Deploy & Secure**](/docs/deploy-secure) — Build and deploy apps directly from Kilo. Run security scans and manage issues with AI assistance.

## Quick Start

1. [Install Kilo Code](/docs/getting-started/installing) in your preferred environment
2. [Connect an AI provider](/docs/ai-providers) or use Kilo's built-in provider & credits
3. [Run your first task](/docs/getting-started/quickstart)
