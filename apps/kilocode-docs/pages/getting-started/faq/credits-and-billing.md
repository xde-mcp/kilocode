# Credits and Billing

This section contains questions about credits, billing, and pricing in Kilo Code.

## Credits

### Why am I seeing requests for "Codestral 2508"?

Kilo Code uses Codestral 2508 (a model by Mistral AI) as the dedicated engine for our Autocomplete feature. It is optimized for speed and low latency, making it perfect for real-time code suggestions.

#### Why is it running in the background?

Because Autocomplete needs to be ready the moment you start typing, the model stays active in the background whenever the feature is enabled. This occurs even if you aren't currently using the Kilo Chat.

#### How much does it cost?

You can use Codestral 2508 for Autocomplete completely for free by configuring it through our Mistral integration.

**Setup Guide:** [Setting up Mistral for Free Autocomplete](https://kilo.ai/docs/code-with-ai/features/autocomplete/mistral-setup#setting-up-mistral-for-free-autocomplete)

#### How to Disable These Requests

If you prefer not to have background requests running, you can turn off the feature entirely:

1. Open your **Kilo Settings**.
2. Navigate to the **Autocomplete** tab.
3. Toggle the feature to **Off**.

{% callout type="note" %}
Disabling this will stop all ghost-text suggestions in your editor.
{% /callout %}

### Why do I have credits, but Kilo shows a low balance or warning?

Kilo credits are not shared between Personal and Organization environments.

If you have credits in one environment but are currently using the other, Kilo may show a low balance or usage warning.

#### How to fix it

**In the IDE**

Use the environment selector dropdown to switch to the account that holds your credits (Personal or the specific Organization).

**In the CLI**

Run:

```
/teams
```

Then choose the environment you want to use.

#### Why this happens

Each environment maintains its own balance and usage tracking to ensure clear billing and access control. Switching environments ensures Kilo is using the correct credit pool.

### How to add VAT number to the invoices.

You can add your VAT number during the credit purchase process.

In the credit purchase window, enable the option “I’m purchasing as a business.”
Once enabled, a field will appear to enter your VAT number.
