## Registration process

Kilo Code provides a simple registration process that gives you access to the latest frontier coding models with your Kilo Code login.

1. Click on "Try Kilo Code for Free" in the extension
1. Sign in with your Google account to kilo.ai
1. kilo.ai will prompt you to open Visual Studio Code
    - When using an IDE in a web browser, you will be asked to copy the API key manually instead
1. Once you allow it to Open VS Code, you must also allow VS Code to open the authorization URL

That's it — you're all set!

### Verify everything works

Before diving in, take a moment to confirm both features are working:

1. **Chat:** Type a message in the Kilo Code chat panel and verify you get a response
2. **Autocomplete:** Open any code file, start typing, and look for inline suggestions (shown in gray text)

Now you can start with [your first task](/getting-started/your-first-task)

**Don't see autocomplete suggestions?** Make sure autocomplete is enabled in the Kilo Code settings (gear icon → Autocomplete). Some file types may not trigger suggestions — try a `.js`, `.ts`, or `.py` file.
