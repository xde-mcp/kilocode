5. Back in Kilo Code settings, pick a model from the dropdown.

## Tips and Notes

- **Subscription Required:** You need an active ChatGPT Plus or Pro subscription. This provider won't work with free ChatGPT accounts. See [OpenAI's ChatGPT plans](https://openai.com/chatgpt/pricing) for more information.
- **No API Costs:** Usage through this provider counts against your ChatGPT subscription, not separately billed API usage.
- **Sign Out:** To disconnect, use the "Sign Out" button in the provider settings.

## Limitations

- **You can't use arbitrary OpenAI API models.** This provider only exposes the models listed in Kilo Code's Codex model catalog.
- **You can't export/migrate your sign-in state with settings export.** OAuth tokens are stored in VS Code SecretStorage, which isn't included in Kilo Code's settings export.
