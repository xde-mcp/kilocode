# Adding More Kilo Credits

Once you've used any initial free Kilo Credits, you can easily add more:

- Subscribe to the [Kilo Pass](#kilo-pass), the most cost effective way to add credits.
- Enable automatic top-up, which automatically purchases additional credits when your balance dips below $5.
- Purchase additional credits as a one-time transaction.

These options are available to purchase from your [personal profile page](https://app.kilo.ai). 

You can also use subscriptions or credits you may have purchased directly with an AI provider by adding your keys on the Bring your own Key (BYOK)](https://app.kilo.ai/byok) settings screen. 

## Kilo Pass

Kilo Pass is a subscription which adds credits to your account every month, along with bonus credits depending on your subscription type and duration.

* Kilo Pass purchased credits never expire.
* Kilo Pass bonus credits expire after 1 month.
* Auto top-up, if configured, will automatically add additional credits as needed, in the event a Kilo Pass subscriber runs out of credits.
* Kilo Pass is available for personal accounts only at this time.

If you are a Kilo Pass subscriber and would like to change your subscription tier, please [contact support](https://kilo.ai/support).

## Transparent Pricing

At Kilo Code, we believe in complete pricing transparency:

- Our pricing matches the model provider's API rates exactly
- We don't take any commission or markup.
- $1 you give us becomes $1 of Kilo credits
- We debit your Kilo credits exactly what the provider charges us in dollars
- You only pay for what you use with no hidden fees

## Future Plans

We're continuously working to improve Kilo Code and expand our offerings:

- Additional LLM providers will be added in the future
- More payment options and other plans are under development
