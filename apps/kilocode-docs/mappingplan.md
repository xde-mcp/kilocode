## Summary

**Reusable as-is:** ~70% of your content maps cleanly

**Needs new pages:** ~12-15 new pages, mostly for newer cloud/platform features

**Condense/remove:** ~10-12 pages that are either too granular or should be folded into parent pages

**Tools Reference:** Decide if this stays in nav or becomes a "Reference" footer link - it's useful but clutters the IA

Want me to mock up the actual sidebar structure with the subheaders?
