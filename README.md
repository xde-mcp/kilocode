## Get Started with the CLI

```bash
# npm
npm install -g @kilocode/cli

# Or run directly with npx
npx @kilocode/cli
```

Then run `kilo` in any project directory to start.

### Autonomous Mode (CI/CD)

Use the `--auto` flag with `kilo run` to enable fully autonomous operation without user interaction. This is ideal for CI/CD pipelines and automated workflows:

```bash
kilo run --auto "run tests and fix any failures"
```

**Important:** The `--auto` flag disables all permission prompts and allows the agent to execute any action without confirmation. Only use this in trusted environments like CI/CD pipelines.
