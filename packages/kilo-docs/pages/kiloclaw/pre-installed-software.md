# Pre-installed Software

Every KiloClaw instance ships with a curated set of system utilities, language runtimes, package managers, and CLI tools. This page documents everything that comes pre-installed in the KiloClaw Docker image so you know what's available out of the box. Where a specific version is listed it reflects the pin in the Dockerfile as of March 2026. Entries marked **unpinned** install the latest available version at image build time and may differ between releases.

## Base Image

KiloClaw is built on **Debian Bookworm** (`debian:bookworm-slim`). Since it's Debian-based, you can use `apt` to install additional packages at any time:

```bash
apt update && apt install -y <package>
```

{% callout type="info" %}
Packages installed via `apt` do not persist across redeploys. If you need a package to survive redeploys, install it from a cron job or startup script on the persistent volume.
{% /callout %}
