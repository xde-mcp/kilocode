# Troubleshooting

## OpenClaw Doctor

OpenClaw Doctor is the recommended first step when something isn't working. It runs diagnostics on your instance and automatically fixes common configuration issues.

To use it:

1. Make sure your instance is running
2. Click **OpenClaw Doctor** on your [dashboard](/docs/kiloclaw/dashboard)
3. Watch the output as it runs — results appear in real time

## Common Questions

### Does Redeploy reset my instance?

No. Redeploy does **not** delete your files, git repos, or cron jobs. It stops the machine, applies the latest platform image and your current configuration, and starts it again with the same persistent storage. Think of it as "update and restart."

### When should I use Restart OpenClaw vs Redeploy?

- **Restart OpenClaw** — Restarts just the OpenClaw process. The machine stays up. Use this for quick recovery from a process-level issue or when you want to apply openclaw config changes.
- **Redeploy** — Stops and restarts the entire machine with the latest image and config. Use this when the changelog shows a redeploy hint, or after changing channel tokens or secrets.

### My bot isn't responding on Telegram/Discord/Slack

1. Check that the channel token is configured in [Settings](/docs/kiloclaw/dashboard#channels)
2. Make sure you **Redeployed** or **Restarted OpenClaw** after saving tokens
3. Check for pending [pairing requests](/docs/kiloclaw/chat-platforms#pairing-requests) — the user may need to be approved
4. Try running **OpenClaw Doctor**

### Accessing and Restoring Config Files

You can directly access the files in /root/.openclaw/ on the [KiloClaw Dashboard](https://app.kilo.ai/claw) using the file browser of the edit files dialog. This can be a useful way to examine or update the config files (especially `openclaw.json`) if you run into an issue. There may also be backups in the form of `openclaw.bak` files that you can manually restore from if needed.

### The gateway shows "Crashed"

The OpenClaw process is automatically restarted when it crashes. Check the Gateway Process tab on your dashboard for the exit code and restart count. If it keeps crashing:

1. Run **OpenClaw Doctor**
2. Try a **Redeploy** to apply the latest platform image
3. If the issue persists, join the [Kilo Discord](https://kilo.ai/discord) and share details in the KiloClaw channel

### I changed the model but the agent is still using the old one

After selecting a new model, click **Save & Provision** to apply it. This refreshes the API key and saves the new model. You may also need to **Restart OpenClaw** for the change to take full effect.

## Gateway Process States

The Gateway Process tab shows the current state of the OpenClaw process inside your machine:

- **Running** — The process is up and handling requests
- **Stopped** — The process is not running
- **Starting** — The process is booting up
- **Stopping** — The process is shutting down gracefully
- **Crashed** — The process exited unexpectedly and will be automatically restarted
- **Shutting Down** — The process is stopping as part of a machine stop or redeploy

## FAQ

### How can I change my model?

You can change the model in two ways:

- **From chat** — Type `/model` in the Chat window within the OpenClaw Control UI to switch models directly.
- **From the dashboard** — Go to [https://app.kilo.ai/claw](https://app.kilo.ai/claw), select the model you want, and click **Save**. No redeploy is needed.

### Can I access the filesystem?

You can access instance files in `/root/.openclaw/` directly from the [KiloClaw Dashboard](https://app.kilo.ai/claw). This is useful for examining or restoring config files — see [Accessing and Restoring Config Files](#accessing-and-restoring-config-files) above. You can also interact with files through your OpenClaw agent using its built-in file tools.

### Can I access my KiloClaw via SSH?

For security reasons, SSH access is currently disabled for all KiloClaw instances. Our primary goal is to provide a secure environment for all users, and restricting direct SSH access is one of the many measures we take to ensure the platform remains safe and protected for everyone.

### How can I update my OpenClaw?

Do **not** click **Update Now** inside the OpenClaw Control UI — this is not supported for KiloClaw instances and may break your setup.

Updates are managed by the KiloClaw platform team to ensure stability. When a new version is available, it will be announced in the **Changelog** on your dashboard. To apply the update, click **Upgrade & Redeploy** from the [KiloClaw Dashboard](/docs/kiloclaw/dashboard#redeploy).

## Architecture Notes

For advanced users — how KiloClaw instances are structured:

- **Dedicated machine** — Each user gets their own machine and persistent volume. There is no shared infrastructure between users.
- **Region-pinned storage** — Your persistent volume stays in the region where your instance was originally created.
- **Network isolation** — OpenClaw binds to loopback only; external traffic is proxied through a Kilo controller.
- **Per-user authentication** — The gateway token is derived per-user for authenticating requests to your machine.
- **Encryption at rest** — Sensitive data (API keys, channel tokens) is encrypted at rest in the machine configuration.
