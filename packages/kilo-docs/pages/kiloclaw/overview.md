# KiloClaw 🦀

KiloClaw is Kilo's hosted [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) service — a one-click deployment that gives you a personal AI agent without the complexity of self-hosting. OpenClaw is an open source AI agent that connects to chat platforms like Telegram, Discord, and Slack.

KiloClaw is powered by KiloCode. The API key is platform-managed, so you never need to bring your own. KiloClaw is currently in **Beta**.

## Why KiloClaw?

- **No infrastructure setup** — Skip Docker, servers, and configuration files
- **Instant provisioning** — Your agent is ready in seconds
- **Powered by KiloCode** — API key is automatically generated and refreshed
- **Uses existing credits** — Runs on your Kilo Gateway balance
- **Multiple free models** — Choose from several models at no additional cost
- **Web UI included** — Access your agent's web interface directly from the dashboard

## Prerequisites

- **Kilo account** — Sign up at [kilo.ai](https://kilo.ai) if you haven't already
- **Gateway credits** — KiloClaw uses your existing [Gateway credits](/docs/gateway/usage-and-billing) for model inference

## Creating an Instance

1. Navigate to your [Kilo profile](https://app.kilo.ai/profile)
2. Click **Claw** in the left navigation

3. Click **Create Instance**
4. Select your preferred model from the dropdown. See all available models at the [Kilo Leaderboard](https://kilo.ai/leaderboard#all-models).

5. Optionally configure chat channels (Telegram, Discord, Slack) — you can also do this later from [Settings](/docs/kiloclaw/dashboard#settings)
6. Click **Create & Provision**

Your instance will be provisioned in seconds. Each instance runs on a dedicated machine with 2 shared vCPUs, 3 GB RAM, and a 10 GB persistent SSD. Once created in a region, your instance always runs there.

## Managing Your Instance

The KiloClaw dashboard gives you full control over your instance.

### Controls

- **Start Machine** — Boot a stopped instance (up to 60 seconds)
- **Restart OpenClaw** — Quick restart of just the OpenClaw process; the machine stays up
- **Redeploy** — This will stop the machine, apply any pending image or config updates, and restart it. The machine will be briefly offline.
- **OpenClaw Doctor** — Run diagnostics and auto-fix common issues

For full details on each control and when to use them, see the [Dashboard Reference](/docs/kiloclaw/dashboard).

### Changelog

The dashboard shows recent platform updates. Some updates include a deploy hint — either **Redeploy Required** or **Redeploy Suggested** — to let you know when to redeploy your instance.

### Pairing Requests

When you initialize a new channel for the first time, or a new device connects to the Control UI, you'll see a pairing request on the dashboard that you need to approve. See [Pairing Requests](/docs/kiloclaw/chat-platforms#pairing-requests) for details.

## Accessing Your Agent

1. Click **Access Code** to get a one-time code (expires in 10 minutes)

{% image src="/docs/img/kiloclaw/access-code-modal.png" alt="Access code modal showing one-time code" width="500" caption="One-time access code with 10-minute expiration" /%}

2. Click **Open** to launch the OpenClaw web interface
3. Enter your access code to authenticate

## Using your OpenClaw Agent

OpenClaw lets you customize your own AI assistant that can actually take action — check your email, manage your calendar, control smart devices, browse the web, and message you on Telegram or Discord when something needs attention. It's like having a personal assistant that runs 24/7, with the skills and access you choose to give it.

## Tool Configuration

KiloClaw deploys with the **full** tool profile, giving your agent unrestricted access to all available tools — filesystem operations (read, write, edit), shell execution, web search, messaging, memory, sub-agents, and more.

Shell commands are still gated by an **allowlist** — unknown commands trigger an approval prompt in the Control UI.

### Changing the Tool Profile

If you want to restrict your agent's capabilities, you can change the tool profile from the OpenClaw Control UI:

1. Open your agent's Control UI (via **OpenClaw** on the dashboard)
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Config** → **Tools** → **Tool Profile**
3. Select a different profile.

Your choice persists across restarts — KiloClaw won't overwrite a customized profile.

For a complete and up-to-date tool configuration reference, see the [OpenClaw Tools documentation](https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools#tools-openclaw).

## Limitations

KiloClaw is currently in **beta**. Current constraints include:

- **One instance per account** — Each user can run a single KiloClaw instance
- **Model availability** — Some models may have rate limits during high demand
- **Session persistence** — Chat history may be cleared during beta updates
- **Feature parity** — Not all OpenClaw features are available in the hosted version yet
