Added a new device authorization flow for Kilo Gateway that makes it easier to connect your editor to your Kilo account. Instead of manually copying API tokens, you can now:

- Scan a QR code with your phone or click to open the authorization page in your browser
- Approve the connection from your browser
- Automatically get authenticated without copying any tokens

This streamlined workflow provides a more secure and user-friendly way to authenticate, similar to how you connect devices to services like Netflix or YouTube.
