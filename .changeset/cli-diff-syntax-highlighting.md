Add syntax highlighting to code edit diffs in the CLI. Diffs now display with language-aware syntax coloring using Shiki, making code changes easier to read. Includes support for 60+ languages, automatic language detection from file extensions, and theme-aware highlighting that works with both light and dark themes. Also increased the diff display limit from 20 to 50 lines with smart context collapsing around changes.
