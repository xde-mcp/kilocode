"kilo-code": patch
---

Introduces the managed codebase indexing feature for Kilo Code Teams and Enterprise organizations. This feature is currently gated to internal customers only. Managed codebase indexing is a branch-aware indexing and search product that does not require any configuration (as opposed to the current codebase indexing feature which relies on a local qdrant instance and configurating an embedding provider).
