Add mode selection to Agent Manager for CLI sessions

- Mode selector in new agent form allows selecting mode (code, architect, debug, etc.) when starting sessions
- Mode selector in session header allows switching modes during running sessions via CLI JSON-IO API
- Modes are fetched from extension and synced with CLI sessions
- Model selector moved below textarea in new agent form for better layout
