Introduces "YOLO" mode, where all approval requests are automatically approved. Initially used for `--auto` mode in the CLI, now available in the extension as well.

⚠️⚠️⚠️

YOLO mode is dangerous, as there is no guarantee what the agent will attempt to do (and get automatic approval for it).
Please use with **extreme caution**.
