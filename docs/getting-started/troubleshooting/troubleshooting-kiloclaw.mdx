# KiloClaw Troubleshooting

## OpenClaw Runtime Layer

Issues originating from the local or hosted OpenClaw environment.

### Typical symptoms

- Agent execution halts or crashes
- Tool invocation errors
- Automation/cron execution issues
- UI rendering or session state problems

**The Heartbeat Check:** Look for `heartbeat` events in the logs. If you see these, the OpenClaw Gateway is alive.

Check the [OpenCLAW Troubleshooting docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai/help/troubleshooting) for a deep dive on OpenCLAW errors.

## Gateway / Provisioning Layer

Issues related to model access, routing, authentication, or billing.

### Typical symptoms

- Provider or model resolution errors
- Authentication failures (401 / 403)
- Rate limiting or quota enforcement
- Credits related questions
- Gateway timeout or upstream provider failures

1. Click **Export visible logs**
2. Attach the exported file when opening a support request

These logs include:

- Session execution traces
