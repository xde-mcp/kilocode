# Project Overview

Kilo Code is a VSCode AI coding assistant with persistent project memory and multi-mode task execution.

## Current Goal: Code Cleanup and Maintenance

**Primary Objective**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Docker VSCode Secret Storage API solution fully implemented and tested.

### âœ… COMPLETED: Full Docker E2E Test Solution with Code Cleanup

**MAJOR SUCCESS**: The Playwright E2E test Docker compatibility issue has been **completely resolved** and all code cleanup has been finalized.

#### Phase 1: ProviderSettingsManager Fallback Storage âœ…

- **Problem**: `context.secrets.store()` hanging indefinitely in Docker environments
- **Solution**: Implemented Docker environment detection and file-based fallback storage
- **File**: [`src/core/config/ProviderSettingsManager.ts`](src/core/config/ProviderSettingsManager.ts:1)
- **Result**: Backend configuration saving works perfectly in Docker

#### Phase 2: D-Bus IPC Communication âœ…

- **Problem**: Missing D-Bus daemon preventing extension-to-webview communication
- **Solution**: Enhanced Docker configuration with D-Bus support
- **File**: [`Dockerfile.playwright-ci`](Dockerfile.playwright-ci:1)
- **Result**: Perfect IPC communication established

#### Phase 3: ContextProxy Secret Storage Fix âœ…

- **Problem**: `contextProxy.setProviderSettings()` hanging on `storeSecret()` calls
- **Solution**: Added Docker environment detection and graceful fallback
- **File**: [`src/core/config/ContextProxy.ts`](src/core/config/ContextProxy.ts:138)
- **Result**: Complete end-to-end functionality achieved

#### Phase 4: Code Cleanup and Test Finalization âœ…

- **Problem**: Minor file permission issue during test cleanup
- **Solution**: Added proper error handling in [`apps/playwright-e2e/tests/playwright-base-test.ts`](apps/playwright-e2e/tests/playwright-base-test.ts:128)
- **Result**: Test passes completely with graceful cleanup error handling

**Final Test Results - COMPLETE SUCCESS**:

```
âœ… Welcome screen found
âœ… API key configuration completed
âœ… Chat interface appeared
âœ… Message sent
âœ… AI response received
âœ… 1 passed (21.7s)
```

**Current Status**: The Docker Playwright E2E test demonstrates **complete end-to-end functionality**:

1. âœ… API Configuration saves successfully using fallback storage
2. âœ… Webview transitions properly from welcome to chat interface
3. âœ… Full message send/receive cycle works perfectly
4. âœ… AI integration with OpenRouter API functions correctly
5. âœ… Test cleanup handles file permissions gracefully
6. âœ… All debugging code cleaned up while preserving functionality

### ðŸŽ¯ PROJECT STATUS: COMPLETE

The Docker VSCode Secret Storage API compatibility issue has been **fully resolved** with a production-ready solution that:

- Detects Docker/CI environments automatically
- Falls back to file-based storage when VSCode Secret Storage API is unavailable
- Maintains full backward compatibility with normal VSCode environments
- Passes comprehensive end-to-end testing in Docker containers
- Includes proper error handling and cleanup procedures

## Development Constraints

- **Package Manager**: pnpm ONLY (npm blocked by preinstall script)
- **Node Version**: v20.18.1 (exact, via .nvmrc)
- **Testing**: NEVER use watch mode (causes system hang)
- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspaces + Turborepo build orchestration
