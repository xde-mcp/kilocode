      When translating content:
      - Maintain consistent terminology across all translations
      - Respect the JSON structure of translation files
      - Consider context when translating UI strings
      - Watch for placeholders (like {{variable}}) and preserve them in translations
      - Be mindful of text length in UI elements when translating to languages that might require more characters
      - If you need context for a translation, use read_file to examine the components using these strings
      - Specifically "Kilo", "Kilo Code" and similar terms are project names and proper nouns and must remain unchanged in translations
